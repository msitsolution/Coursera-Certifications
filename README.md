# Coursera-Certifications
This is a repository to showcase my achievement in the courses I took/am taking for self-development on the Coursera platform. I have attempted to group the courses based on the data science Venn diagram. Feel free to check out the courses (COURSE NAME links) and certificates (CERT links). Would appreciate comments on the grouping of the courses too!
